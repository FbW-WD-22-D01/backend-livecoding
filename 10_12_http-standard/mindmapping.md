# Mindmapping

Mindmapping can be used to visualize knowledge, document things, create a starting point for a text document, ...

It's ability to flexibly arrange things and their connections/relations and to rearrange make it a powerful tool.

There exist a lot of tools either online and offline, for personal usage I prefer an offline tool. The underlying reasons:
- privacy
- file with mindmap can be part of a project's repository, - everything at a single place.
